## Welcome to my authenticated blog post editor :)

This application uses authentication to provide the client with a token to which they can access the different routes of the app. 
You can add new articles, update existing ones and delete ones that you no longer want!

This was a fun and challenging project that definitely put my skills to the test. 
We were given a base project with little code other than the skeletons of some components with instructions and an end goal deployed. 
We used authentication, all facets of API usage, tricky logic and more!

Enjoy!
